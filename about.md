Ryan Skelskey spent the majority of his career involved in social services 
and education before making his move to the city of San Francisco. Since 
his transition to the West Coast, Ryan has worked to create Tailor Maid 
SF, a successful bridal tailoring service, as well as Head Lands 
Productions, a videography and editing company based in Fairfax, CA. 
Although he is no longer teaching, Ryan still finds time to volunteer for 
educational programs like Break Through San Francisco and currently 
assists the Fairfax Community Church with their weekly Food Pantry.

## Solid Foundation

Ryan has a long track record of putting forth outstanding efforts in 
business, his personal life, and academic career. Raised in Bristol, CT by 
his mother and grandparents, Ryan attended Eastern High School where 
he graduated with honors. Later, he would attend CCSU and then the 
University of Cincinnati where he earned a Bachelor’s Degree in 
Secondary education, graduating with a 4.0 GPA.  Ryan also tested in the 
top tier of the nation on the Praxis II exam before passing California’s 
CBEST test. 

## Strong Work Ethic

Ryan has been gainfully employed since his first job in a local pet store at 
the age of 14. By working multiple positions he was able to put himself 
through college without assistance and is proud to say he truly paved his 
own path. Ryan’s drive and determination has pushed him through a wide 
variety of endeavors although he found his most rewarding positions 
working as a Child Development Specialist, mentor, and teacher. Ryan’s 
motivation has continued to serve him through his recent ventures as 
owner and manager of two growing businesses.

## Giving Back

In addition to his successes in business and academia, Ryan Skelskey has 
consistently given back to the community throughout his life.  Whether 
working with children in under-served communities or collaborating with 
mental health professionals in residential treatment facilities, Ryan has 
strived to help make the world a little easier for children and families in 
need.
