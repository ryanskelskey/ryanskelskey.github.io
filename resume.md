### Qualifications
I have extensive experience working with children ages twelve to eighteen in a therapeutic setting as well as in the classroom.  I successfully completed my teaching internship at Withrow University, an inner-city high school in Cincinnati, and was awarded my teaching certificate in March of 2008. Before my experience in the classroom, I spent close to two years working as a Child Development Assistant and was eventually promoted to Child Development Specialist at a residential treatment facility in New Britain, CT.  I have worked closely with teachers, therapists, doctors and DCF staff making recommendations and implementing treatment plans for children with mental health issues as well as victims of abuse and neglect.  In addition, I have taken full responsibility of my own classroom and have had positive results working with economically disadvantaged and at-risk high school students.  Since moving to California I have passed the CBEST test and Volunteered for San Francisco's Breakthrough program helping highly motivated students with limited educational opportunities. I also have more than ten years experience working in the service industry as a server and bartender which has helped me further develop and enhance my interpersonal skills.
